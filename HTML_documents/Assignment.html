		</p>Here is a quote from T.S. Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats:
		<blockquote cite="http://https://bookroo.com/quotes/old-possums-book-of-practical-cats.html">
			<p>“The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,

			It isn’t just one of your holiday games;

			You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter

			When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.”</p>
		</blockquote>
