# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
To be used for classes by The Tech Academy.

Hightlights from my HTML and CSS Projects class at The Tech Academy:

Final Assignment:
Personal software developer website: I utilized HTML to create the skeleton of my website and used CSS to add style and beauty to my page including a table with background color and transparency, a background video, and hover effects.

One Page Website:
I used mostly HTML with some basic CSS to create a band website.

Bootstrap4 project:
I used bootstrap elements to create a website for a local movie theater.

Final Challenge:
Here I experimented and got familiar with image filters, tables, and looping video. I added an overlay to the image and video to create text that eases in on top.

Project:
I recreated a complex website for a space flight company with a nine image gallery and contact form.
